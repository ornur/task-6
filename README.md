# Graph Algorithms

This project provides implementations of graph algorithms in Java.

## Overview

The project contains the following classes:

- `WeightedGraph`: Represents a weighted graph data structure.
- `MyGraph`: Represents a graph data structure.
- `Search`: Provides a base class for graph search algorithms.
- `BreadthFirstSearch`: Implements breadth-first search algorithm.
- `DepthFirstSearch`: Implements depth-first search algorithm.
- `DijkstraSearch`: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ornur/graph-algorithms.git
